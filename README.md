# LoRa_inAir4_Client_Server
Arduino code for simple Client and Server using Modtronix LoRa SX1278 inAir4 module
http://wiki.modtronix.com/doku.php?id=projects:arduino-lora-server-client1

This code is based on following code:
https://github.com/a3rd/lora-inair4/wiki/Setup-HOWTO

Which in turn was based on the Arduino code that HopeRF made to interface their LoRa module. It has been adapted
and tested to work with the inAir4 LoRa module and an Arduino Nano.
